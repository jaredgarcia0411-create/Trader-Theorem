# This is my *Trader Theorem* Beta
## Started off as a log in lieu of a paid service, but aim now is to have a product for not just logging, but journaling, categorizing, watchlists, backtesting & whatever else I want really.
### Future Update List
- UI/UX to be refined & consistent across all tabs & features.
- Make the site secure through back end server with 3 legged OAUTH (free with minimal users)
- Handle logging options (only handled short sells at first)
- Notes on individual trades up to 600 characters & 2 .pdf's.
- Sync with Google Sheets & Polygon API/or Charles Schwab API to build out 'Backtesting' tab based on hisitorical data as well as context given.
- Watchlist with defined presets (Hoooooly API's are expensive)
- Auth0 2.0 compliant as well as API safeguards prior to testing
- Agent connected to scrape EDGAR & perform DD on companies that you set a filter on (market cap, key words in X time frame, news events, etc)
- Comments/Code/Suggestions all welcome
- Yes this was vibe coded
- No I don't know how to actually code
- Yes I'm trying to learn how to *actually* code

### Completed Updates
- Updated to handle long & short trades.
- Updated to add custom tags for individual trades. Type it once & will save for future use.
- Added feature to delete tags, ya know, in case there's a typo (lol)
- Updated with seperate 'Filter' tab that shows $ & R metrics for any mix of tags you'd like to analyze.
