# This is my 'Trading Journal' Beta *Trader Theorem*
## Started off as a log in lieu of a paid service, but aim now is to have a product for not just logging, but journaling, categorizing, watchlists, backtesting & whatever else I want really.
### Future Update List
- Updating to log options (only handled short sells at first)
- Updating to put notes on individual trades up to 600 characters & 2 .pdf's.
- Updating to sync with Google Sheets & Polygon API to build out 'Backtesting' tab based on hisitorical data as well as context given.
- Updating to build watchlist with defined presets (Hoooooly API's are expensive)
- Updating with Charles Schwab Market Data API to test with Auth0 2.0 prior to testing Polygon/Massive API
- Comments/Code/Suggestions all welcome
- Yes this was vibe coded
- No I don't know how to actually code
- Yes I'm trying to learn how to *actually* code

### Completed Updates
- Updated to handle long & short trades.
- Updated to add custom tags for individual trades. Type it once & will save for future use.
- Added feature to delete tags, ya know, in case there's a typo (lol)
- Updated with seperate 'Filter' tab that shows $ & R metrics for any mix of tags you'd like to analyze.
